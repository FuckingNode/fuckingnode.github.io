</div>

**F\*ckingNode is a CLI tool that automates tasks and gives you tools to make JavaScript development less of a f\*cking headache.** We can't fix your bugs, but we can automate most headache-giving tasks across all of your NodeJS/Deno/Bun projects and give you a set of tools to make JS development great again.

Note: For whatever reason, _very few_ features can also be used with Golang and Rust. Don't question it, just enjoy it.

## Features

- [x] automated cleanup of JS projects
- [x] automated cleanup of global caches (especially useful for pnpm or Bun, where a single global cache exists)
- [x] automated updates of JS projects' dependencies
- [x] automated linting of JS projects
- [x] automated prettying of JS projects
- [x] automated removal of unneeded files (e.g. dist/, out/...)
- [x] automated commit of lint / prettify / update changes in your code
- [x] automated release / update process of npm / jsr packages
- [x] automated cloning of a repo, installation of dependencies, and opening of your favorite editor for a project
- [x] automated cross-manager (e.g. npm -> pnpm) or cross-runtime (e.g. NodeJS/npm -> Bun) migration

— **from a single command.** It's not magic, it's _F\*ckingNode_-and that name is shipping to production.

Plus other features like:

- [x] a security audit assistant that analyzes vulnerabilities and tells you if they _do_ affect your project or can be safely ignored, from a single command
- [x] addition of a pre-configured `tsconfig.json` or `.gitignore` file for your project, from a single command
- [x] automated removal of entire `node_modules` across all of your projects for _storage emergencies_, from, you guessed it, single command

And that's it for now.
