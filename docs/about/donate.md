# Support the development of FuckingNode

FuckingNode is a solo project, developed and maintained with a lot of effort by myself. I'm a student with no fixed income, and donations would be significantly helpful.

While there isn't an intrinsic economic cost to keeping FuckingNode alive, the real investment is a lot of time and effort; time that might otherwise have to be spent on whatever source of income I find. I don't need this project to generate revenue, but if it did, it would directly impact how much dedication I can give to it.

If FuckingNode has ever saved you time or made a task easier, please consider supporting its development. I would really appreciate it.

Plus, you'll be listed anywhere I can think of :]
