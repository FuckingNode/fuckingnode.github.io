# FuckingNode branding guidelines

Just in case you wanted to write an article or make a video about us (thank you!). We're not Nintendo, of course we won't sue you if you don't strictly follow these rules. We do appreciate you respecting them, though.

## The logo

You can use our logo just as you'd use any app's logo in a post, video, or any kind of visual content that requires it (with proper attribution, of course). Black, white, and colored WEBP files are available from [this website's repository](https://github.com/FuckingNode/fuckingnode.github.io/tree/main/docs).

## The name

Ideally, capitalize it as FuckingNode. Preferably use the **Mona Sans** typography, an [open source font](https://github.com/mona-sans) we use for our main branding. The asterisk (F\*ckingNode) is optional. If used, censor the U and not any other letter (avoid things like <s>F\*\*kingNode</s>).

### Can acronyms or abbreviations be used?

`FkNode` and `FKN` the only valid abbreviations. We encourage to use the full name instead, though.

## Colors

**Keep the logo white or black.** If you want to color it, use our main color, `#B86549`.

## Disclaimer

**Our logo, name, and branding are _ours_**. They're made with love and effort and they may not be used anywhere without either crediting us or having our explicit consent. Copyright actions may be taken if we see them necessary; so we hope you'll be able to abide by such a simple rule.
