# FuckingNode branding guidelines

Just in case you wanted to write an article or make a video about us (thank you!). We're not Nintendo, of course we won't sue you if you don't follow these _rules_ whatsoever. They're here just in case you don't know how to represent the branding of such a project or simply wanted to ensure you stick to our ideals (thank you for that too!).

## The logo

You can use our logo just as you'd use any app's logo in a post, video, or any kind of visual content that requires it (with proper attribution, of course). Black and white PNGs are available from [this website's repository](https://github.com/FuckingNode/fuckingnode.github.io).

## The name

Ideally, capitalize it as FuckingNode. Preferably use the **Mona Sans** typography, an [open source font](https://github.com/mona-sans) we use for our main branding. The asterisk (F*ckingNode) is optional. If used, censor the U and not any other letter (avoid things like <s>F\*\*kingNode</s>).

### Can acronyms or abbreviations be used?

`FkNode` and `FKN` the only valid abbreviations. We encourage to use the full name instead, though.

## Colors

**Keep the logo white or black.** If you _really_ want to color it, go for `#B86549`, our main branding color, and the one used in this website.

## Needless to say

Our logo, name, and branding are _ours_. They're made with love and effort and they may not be used anywhere without either crediting us or having our explicit consent. Copyright actions may be taken if we see them necessary; so we hope you'll be able to abide by such a simple rule.

Thanks for passing by, I guess.
