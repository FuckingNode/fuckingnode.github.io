# F*ckingNode branding guidelines

Just in case you wanted to write an article or make a video about us (thank you!). We're not Nintendo, of course we won't sue you if you don't follow this _rules_ whatsoever. They're here just in case you don't know how to represent the branding of such a project or simply wanted to ensure you stick to our ideals (thank you for that too!).

## The logo

You can use our logo just as you'd use any app's logo in a post, video, or any kind of visual content that requires it. With proper attribution, of course. A PNG is available from our main repository.

Please don't alter it however. Only valid change is making it full black (`#000`) instead of full white (`#FFF`) for usage over light backgrounds.

## The name

Ideally, capitalize it as FuckingNode. The asterisk (F*ckingNode) is optional. If used, censor the U and not any other letter (<s>F\*ckingNode</s>).

There isn't any preference towards font families to be used. We recommend a `monospace` font.

### Can acronyms or abbreviations be used?

`FkNode` and `FKN` the only valid abbreviation. We encourage to use the full name instead, though.

## Colors

**Keep the logo white or black.** If you _really_ want to color it, go for either light green (like this documentation site's accent color), or orange. `#FCA737` (our classic orange) or `#65BA4F` (lightened NodeJS' logo green) could do.

## Something needless to say

Our logo, name, and branding are _ours_. They're made with love and effort and they may not be used anywhere without either crediting us or having our explicit consent. Copyright actions might be taken if we see them necessary; we hope you'll be able to abide by such a simple rule.

Thanks for passing by, I guess.
