# Learn: How does F*ckingNode work from the inside?

For wannabe contributors or people curious / bored enough, all pages in here explain in detail how does each feature work from an insider perspective.

Only features worth including are mentioned - not because other features are worthless, but because some of them simply don't need a page.

> `fuckingnode setup` for example is simple enough to be understood; a list of templates, you give it a name, and if a template with that name exists, it creates a file and writes the template to it (or overwrites an existing one, deep-merging if possible).
> It's simplicity saves us a few pages up.
