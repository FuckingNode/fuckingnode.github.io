# Learn: How does FuckingNode work from the inside?

For wannabe contributors or curious / bored enough people, pages in here explain in detail how do our most important features work from an insider perspective.

Only features worth including are mentioned - not because other features are worthless, but because some of them simply don't need a page.

> `fuckingnode setup` for example is simple enough to be understood; a list of templates, you give it a name, and if a template with that name exists, it creates a file and writes the template to it (or overwrites an existing one, deep-merging if possible).
>
> Its simplicity removes the need to make a "learning page", saving a few pages up.
