# Using FuckingNode: Launch a project

> `fuckingnode launcher <project>`, or `fklaunch <project>`

The `launch` command is a simple extra command that automatically launches your favorite editor with a project open and updates your dependencies. It can take a project's name from the `package.json` / `deno.json` / `Cargo.toml`, so it's as simple as doing `fklaunch my-project`.

## Usage

Just run the following:

```bash
fuckingnode launch < PROJECT >
```

`PROJECT` is obvious and mandatory. It can be a relative file path, absolute file path, or the project's name as mentioned before.
