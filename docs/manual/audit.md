# Using FuckingNode: Audit a project

> `fuckingnode audit [project-name]`

The `audit` command is a command that automatically runs a security audit for a project you specify (or for all projects if no name is specified), and interrogates security vulnerabilities (if any) to determine if they're worth fixing.

This is better explained [here](../learn/audit.md).
