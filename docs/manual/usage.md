# Using FuckingNode: the most important command

> `fuckingnode clean [...many optional arguments]`, or `fkclean [...many optional arguments]`

The core idea of FuckingNode is to automate cleanup of your NodeJS projects. On top of that base, additional maintenance features and [cross-runtime support](cross-runtime.md) exist as well.

## The `clean` command

The `fuckingnode clean` command is the base utility of the app. It accepts the following (all optional) arguments:

```bash
fuckingnode clean < PROJECT | -- > < INTENSITY | -- > [--update] [--lint] [--pretty] [--destroy] [--verbose] [--commit]
```

When executed with no arguments, it'll do a cleanup using the default intensity (which is `normal` and can be changed from the [settings](configuration.md#settings)) across all of your projects.

## Cleaner intensities, explained

There are five (well, three in reality) intensities available:

- `normal`
- `hard`
- `maxim`

and additional `hard-only` and `maxim-only` levels.

This graph demonstrates what does each level do.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[NORMAL]
    B[HARD]
    C[HARD-ONLY]
    D[MAXIM]
    I[MAXIM-ONLY]

	E[Per-project cleanup commands]
	F[Global cleanup commands]
	G[Removal of node_modules]

	A-->E
	B-->E
	B-->F
	C-->F
    D-->E
	D-->F
	D-->G
    I-->G
```

The `normal` level recursively "cleans" each of your project. We define "cleaning" by automatically running all the features your package manager provides for this task (you might not even know about commands like `npm dedupe`, right?).

The `hard` level does the previous (unless using `hard-only`), plus cleans global caches. This will make the most sense for `pnpm` user, which is known for it's global module cache, however cleaning is made for all package managers.

!!! warning "Regarding npm's cache"
    As `npm` itself warns you when cache cleaning manually, it will make `npm` even slower than what it already is next time you use it. Our recommendation is simple: to use `pnpm` as your default package manager. Don't remove `npm`, though, as compatibility issues may appear.

We recommend running `normal` cleanups in a mid-frequent basis, and `hard` cleanups two or three times a month. That's our recommendation, of course. Do whatever you please with your PC.

The `maxim` level does what the previous levels do (unless using `hard-only`), and also the removes `node_modules` directory (forcing you to reinstall dependencies next time you want to code).

!!! tip "Why does maxim even exist?"
    For average use, it is discouraged. However, in some cases, it can be useful, as our registered record is of **11 recovered gigabytes storage after using this cleanup** (yes, eleven). So, for example, if you needed to download a particularly big file and completely forgot your drive is almost full, this command will free up a particularly big chunk of your hard drive.

---

Now that we know this, we can choose whatever fits our needs each time we run a cleanup

```bash
fuckingnode clean -- normal
fuckingnode clean -- hard
fuckingnode clean -- hard-only
fuckingnode clean -- maxim
fuckingnode clean -- maxim-only
```

Running without an intensity will use the **default intensity**. On a fresh install, it's always `normal`, however [that can be changed to your linking from the settings command](configuration.md#settings).

Notice the `--`. `clean` takes a project path / name as a first optional argument. If given (and different from `--`), that specific project will be cleaned (and global caches when `hard` cleanup). If not given, or `--` given, every single project from your list will be cleaned one by one, saving you even more time.

## Configuring a project's behavior

Before continuing, something you should know about is `fknode.yaml`. It's our own text-config file, similar to other config files you're likely used to (`.prettierrc`, `.eslintrc.js`...).

It's completely opt-in and not required whatsoever. However, it can be really useful (and some additional features do require specific configuration from this file). [Click here to learn about it.](fknode-yaml.md).

## Using additional features

By default, `fuckingnode clean (project) (intensity)` only performs a cleanup of the desired level. Features we promised you (automated updating, linting, prettifying, destroying, and committing) are opt-in features.

There are two ways of activating them:

**1 /** Simply pass them as a flag to use them. No args are required for any of them.

```bash
fuckingnode clean -- -- --update --lint --pretty --destroy --commit
# or
fuckingnode clean -- -- -u -l -p -d -c
# or even shorter
fkclean -- -- -u -l -p -d -c
```

**2 /** For a specific project to automatically use some features without the need of the `clean` command having the flag specified, use `flagless` in the `fknode.yaml` file:

```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="17"
flagless:
    flaglessLint: true
    flaglessPretty: true
    # etc etc...
```

Available flags are:

| Flag          |           Why does this exist |
| :------------ | ----------------------------: |
| `--lint`      |      does the obvious (lints) |
| `--pretty`    | does the obvious (prettifies) |
| `--destroy`\* |  does the obvious (destroys*) |
| `--commit`    |    does the obvious (commits) |
| `--update`    |    does the obvious (updates) |

\* if not obvious enough, removes files and directories you specify, such as `.react`, `out/`, `dist/`, or anything you want gone.

!!! abstract "Cross-runtime support notice"

    Some advanced features won't work everywhere. See [cross-runtime support](../learn/cross-runtime-support.md) for more info.

Some of these features depend on `fknode.yaml` configuration, [as noted above](#configuring-a-projects-behavior).

### Callouts

!!! info "About errors"

    Any error from additional tasks will fail silently; this means they won't stop the execution flow and no logs will be made. However, since the CLI shows command output live, errors will likely be shown in there.

### Linting your code: `--lint`

When linting, we will automatically run your linter. By default, we use ESLint - which in most cases should just work out of the box. Still, for convenience, you're able to choose a different linter.

More precisely, `--lint` runs `eslint --fix .` on each of your projects, unless overridden.

To override it, create a script in your `package.json` scripts object that runs your preferred linter, then copy the name of the script and paste it as the value for the `lintCmd` key on your `fknode.yaml`.

For example:

```jsonc title="package.json" linenums="6"
scripts: {
    "linter": "someLinter --fix --force ." // or whatever
}
```

```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="1"
lintCmd: "linter"
```

### Prettifying your code: `--pretty`

When prettying, we will automatically run your prettifier. By default, we use Prettier - which just as ESLint should work, and just as ESLint can be changed anyway.

More precisely, `--pretty` runs `prettier --w .` on each of your projects, unless overridden.

To override it, do the same as with the linter but setting the `prettyCmd` key instead.

For example:

```jsonc title="package.json" linenums="6"
scripts: {
    "prettifier": "not-prettier --trailing-coma --line-width 120 --force ." // or whatever
}
```

```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="2"
prettyCmd: "prettifier"
```

### Destroying your <s>code</s> files: `--destroy`

When destroying, we will automatically remove files and directories you specified.

You already know what command this will run (your operating system's default file removal command).

!!! abstract "Don't forget!"

    `fknode.yaml` allows (and requires) you to specify on which intensities you'd like this to run (so for example, one project will always `destroy` upon cleanup, and other project will only `destroy` upon a `hard` cleanup). Other commands do not currently support specifying per intensity level usage rules.

To configure it, add a `destroy` key to the `fknode.yaml` with two sub-items: an array called `intensities`, and a list called `targets`, to specify paths to files to be deleted **relative to the root of the project** (or absolute if you will).

For example:

```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="3"
destroy:
    intensities: [
        "hard",
        "maxim",
    ]
    targets:
        - "out"
        - "cache"
        - ".react"
        - ".whateverFramework"
```

You can use an asterisk (`*`) if you want to destroy with all intensities without typing all of that. _Due to how the CLI is designed, it must still be an array, so `["*"]` works and `"*"` doesn't._

### Committing your code: `--commit`

When committing, we will automatically commit our changes (updating, linting, prettifying) to Git, using a default commit message unless overridden.

`commit` will be executed directly, without changing branches whatsoever.

For your own safety, we will commit ONLY IF ALL of the following conditions are TRUE:

- There were no uncommitted changes _BEFORE_ we touched your projects.
- There are no changes from upstream that haven't been pulled.
- You EXPLICITLY allowed committing for that project in the `fknode.yaml` file.

!!! success "Safety first."
    While features you opt-in when cleaning are automatically used on **all** projects as noted above, an exception was made for committing, requiring explicit allowance for your own safety.

    To allow a project's code to be committed, add the following to your `fknode.yaml`:

    ```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="14"
    commitActions: true # authorize commits
    ```

### Updating your code: `--update`

When updating, we will automatically update your dependencies using your project's package manager (we'll know that based on your lockfile). By default, the standard update command is used, though you can actually override this command too.

> Personally, I didn't think that was useful until I found out (the bad way) why `expo` "reinvented the wheel" with `expo install --check` and encouraged users to use that instead of `npm update` - I had to reinstall everything several times to get the project to compile again. So yes, in some cases you do need a specific command for dependencies. We got you covered for those cases.

Unless overridden, you already know what command this will run (`npm update` or `pnpm update` or whatever you use).

To override it, do the same as with the linter and prettifier, but setting the `updateCmdOverride` key instead. The name is slightly more verbose, as while as I told you sometimes you might need this, in most cases it could even be a bad idea to override the update command.

```yaml title="fknode.yaml" linenums="15"
updateCmdOverride: "update"
```

## Additional info

### Show additional info during cleanup

There's a `--verbose` flag that can be passed to `fuckingnode clean`. It'll show the real output of all commands that are being executed, begin and end timestamps for the cleanup process, plus a report showing how much time did it take us to clean each individual project.
