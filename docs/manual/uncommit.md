# Using FuckingNode: Unmake a commit

> `fuckingnode uncommit`, or `fkuncommit`

The `uncommit` command in FuckingNode allows you to quickly remake a commit. It automatically undoes the last local commit (storing its name), then hangs for you to modify its files as needed, and once you tell it to run, it re-runs `commit` (including `commitCmd` if any) and remakes the commit with the same message.

## Usage

To uncommit changes to your project, just run this from the root of the repo:

```bash
fuckingnode uncommit
```

### What to expect

You'll see a confirmation like this one, showing what will be made:

```txt
‚ùì We will unstage all currently staged files (if any), and immediately undo commit 39a6d31.
If you terminate the program you won't recover it, it's us who handle remaking it. Proceed?
Confirm? [y/N]
```

If you input `y`, the commit will be unmade and you'll see this:

```txt
Undid commit 39a6d31 (some wrong commit, by ZakaHaceCosas at Sun Sep 28 15:30:47 2025 +0200)

Make any modifications to the existing files now.
Use regular git commands (git add / git remove) from a separate terminal to stage/unstage files.
Once done, come to this terminal and hit 'Y',
    we'll run your commitCmd (if any) and re-make the commit with the same message and files (unless changed) as before.
You may hit 'n' as well, result will be the same.

waiting for you to hit 'Y' [y/N] 
```

After hitting `y` (or `n`), our [commit command](commit.md) will immediately run and your commit will be remade (unless a `commitCmd` exists and fails, of course).
