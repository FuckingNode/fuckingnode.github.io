# FuckingNode documentation

Live at [this URL](https://fuckingnode.github.io/). Documentation website for the FuckingNode CLI tool. Also includes installer scripts.

## Installer scripts

In the root of `docs/` you'll find Windows `.ps1` and macOS/Linux `.sh` installers for FuckingNode. These scripts will download the executable and add it to `PATH`, **plus create a bunch of `.ps1`/`.sh` shorthand files**.
